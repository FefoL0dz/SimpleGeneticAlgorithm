//TODO: list of things that must to be implemented before project submission:

(1) - Change this thing that sets genotypeSize by dimensionality!
(2) - Put fitness attribute in Phenotype POJO!
(3) - Create a method to verify convergence before the time (overfitting)!
(4) - Create a method to verify solution quality before/after verify end of times.
(5) - Verify if q1 function is correct comparing with Sarajason GA ppt's.
(6) - See if the variable used it's genotypeSize or populationSize.
(7) - correct individuals generator responsibilities.
